<p>Hey you explorer! I am Ajay, the guy behind the keyboard.
   I am a student of computer science engineering at SASTRA University. While my academic performance is solid,
  you may find me uninspired in my college hours. But outside the classroom doors, I refuel my energy levels, preparing myself 
  for a good movie night, a pump hard workout or just casual chatter with 
  my friends. This is my professional catalog in which i share my progress and achivements in the projects that I work on.
  So I am really excited to showcase my work to you, my sincere appreciation to anyone who stumbles upon to gaze my gallery!   </p>
